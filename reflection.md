- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

My class represents a virtual garden. It allows you to grow plants, remove them, pick plants to put in a basket that you can use later, as well as take walks around the garden, and other activities. 

Methods: 
examine: look at a plant to see if it's ready to be picked
grab: picks a plant from the garden and puts it in the user's basket
drop: drops an item into the garden by mistake
use: removes plant from your basket to use outside of your garden
walk: walk around the garden, using up user's energy level
fly: spray pesticide to get rid of flies in your garden
shrink: calculate how many of a certain type of plant you will have left if you pick a certain amount
grow: plant something in your garden
rest: takes a rest which allows the user to raise their energy level
undo: take something out that you have already planted in your garden with grow method, this throws out the plant entirely instead of removing it from the garden to put in the basket like the grab method does
 */


- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

I didn't implement any new methods but I overloaded both the grow and shrink method. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think I picked a class that the methods could be applied to but I would have liked to create more advanced undo and drop methods.
